# Network Protocol Fundamentals

## OSI Model Overview

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system. The OSI model characterizes computing functions into a universal set of rules and requirements in order to support interoperability between different products and software.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer

The Physical Layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or optical signals.

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer provides node-to-node data transfer between two directly connected nodes. It also handles error correction from the physical layer. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers: the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.

### Layer 3: Network Layer

The Network Layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers. It provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source to a destination host via one or more networks.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer

The Transport Layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems. It is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer.

### Layer 5: Session Layer

The Session Layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications. It sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end.

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer establishes context between application-layer entities. If there is a mapping between the different semantics used by the different application-layer entities, this layer can provide that mapping.

### Layer 7: Application Layer

The Application Layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The TCP/IP protocol suite is the set of communications protocols used for the Internet and other similar networks. It is named after two of its most important protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP).

### IP Addressing

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses have two principal functions: network interface identification and location addressing.

#### IPv4

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296 addresses. IPv4 reserves some addresses for special purposes such as private networks or multicast addresses.

#### IPv6

IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, theoretically allowing 2^128 addresses. IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits with the groups being separated by colons.

### TCP Protocol

TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, and file transfer rely on TCP.

### UDP Protocol

UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram.

## DNS System

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

### DNS Record Types

- **A Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address
- **CNAME Record**: Creates an alias for a domain name
- **MX Record**: Specifies mail servers for a domain
- **TXT Record**: Holds text information
- **NS Record**: Specifies authoritative name servers

## HTTP Protocol

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.

### HTTP Methods

- GET: Requests a representation of the specified resource
- POST: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource
- PUT: Replaces all current representations of the target resource
- DELETE: Deletes the specified resource
- PATCH: Applies partial modifications to a resource
- HEAD: Same as GET but without the response body
- OPTIONS: Describes communication options for the target resource

## Security Protocols

### TLS/SSL

Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

### HTTPS

HTTPS is an extension of HTTP. It is used for secure communication over a computer network. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using TLS.
