# Distributed Systems Architecture

## Fundamentals of Distributed Computing

A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers on a network. These devices split up the work, coordinating their efforts to complete the job more efficiently than if a single device had been responsible for the task.

## CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:

1. **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
2. **Availability**: Every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
3. **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped by the network between nodes

## Consensus Algorithms

### Paxos

Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable processors. Consensus is the process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants.

### Raft

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to Paxos. It was designed to be more understandable than Paxos by separating the key elements of consensus.

## Data Replication

Data replication is the process of storing data in more than one site or node. It is useful for improving the availability of data.

### Primary-Backup Replication

In primary-backup replication, one replica is designated as the primary. The primary replica processes all client requests. After processing each request, the primary updates the backup replicas.

### Multi-Primary Replication

In multi-primary replication, any replica can process client requests. After processing a request, the replica must coordinate with other replicas to resolve any conflicts.

## Message Queues

Message queues provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.

### Apache Kafka

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.

### RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms.

### Service Discovery

Service discovery is how microservices locate each other. Common patterns include client-side discovery and server-side discovery.

### API Gateway

An API gateway is a server that acts as an API front-end, receives API requests, enforces throttling and security policies, passes requests to the back-end service, and then passes the response back to the requester.

### Circuit Breaker

The circuit breaker pattern prevents an application from performing an operation that is likely to fail. It wraps a protected function call in a circuit breaker object.

## Load Balancing

Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers.

### Algorithms

- Round Robin
- Least Connections
- IP Hash
- Weighted Round Robin
- Least Response Time

## Caching Strategies

### Cache-Aside

The application first checks the cache. If the data is found in the cache, the data is returned. If not, the database is queried, the cache is updated, and the data is returned.

### Write-Through

Data is written to the cache and the database at the same time. The cached data allows for fast retrieval while keeping the database consistent.

### Write-Behind

Data is written only to the cache. The cache then writes data to the database asynchronously.

## Event Sourcing

Event sourcing persists the state of a business entity as a sequence of state-changing events. Rather than storing the current state, you store all changes to that state.

## CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store.
